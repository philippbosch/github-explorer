Github Explorer
===============

I started this project during [JSConf.eu 2010](http://jsconf.eu/2010) where I learned more about some cool technologies like [sammy.js](http://github.com/quirkey/sammy) which kicks ass badly.

Github Explorer is not a real project, more like a playground for me to try out some new stuff. Especially it would be nice to be able to replace jQTouch with something new for mobile web app development.

Take what you want. Contribute if you have additions. We'll see where this all leads to.
